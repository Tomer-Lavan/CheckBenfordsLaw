# CheckBenfordsLaw
I went to a lecture abo generating fake images with AI and deepfake, the lecture raise my intreset in algorithms and methods to detect fake images.
Today when we see a photo our first tendency is to believe that the picture is real but in a few years it might not be the case.
One weekend I encounterd Benfords Law an interesting law that is used also to detect faked data.
I wrote the program to check if benfords law valid on somthing simple like on text when each word have a numric value and added a nice visualization to see the distribution.
